#### I'm amin and currently I'm senior student of computer software engineering.
I have worked as an android native programmer (with kotlin) and done some backend projects with node js in the past. <br>
At the time I am working on two projects. One is my bachelor thesis and it aims using of datamining methods to classify cloth images. <br>
The second that I'm working on it in my spare time is an IoT project and It is based on node-red platform. <br>
I guess, I'm searching for my passion. ðŸ™‚
